## Basic Usage

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewDemo />} />

### Behavior

Notifications appear without warning, but they don't block users from interacting with page content.

Notifications without actions can auto-dismiss after 8 seconds. Avoid using auto-dismissing notifications unless there's also inline feedback.

Notifications with actions must remain on the screen until the user takes an action on the notification, or dismisses it.
