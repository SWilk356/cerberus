} from '@/app/components/Admonition'
import OverviewList from '@/app/components/OverviewList'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Navigate to and activate links with assistive tech (i.e., focus)'
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Similarly styled components shouldn't be used together if they don't each pass the 3:1 contrast ratio. Higher contrast helps differentiate between a group of similar components.
