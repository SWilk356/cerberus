## Single Date Picker

<CodePreview preview={<StaticPreview id="guidelines-static" />} />

Generally, use a single date picker when the user needs to select a single date.

## Range Date Picker


<CodePreview preview={<RangePreview id="guidelines-range" />} />

Use a range date picker when the user needs to select a range of dates.

## Responsive Layouts

Datepickers are not mobile-friendly by default. If you need to use a datepicker on mobile, consider swapping between native select inputs (i.e. month, day, and year) and a datepicker based on the screen size.
