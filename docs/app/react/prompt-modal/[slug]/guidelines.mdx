## Non-destructive Usage

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need the user to input data to validate an action from happening." />

<CodePreview preview={<NonDestructivePreview />} />

### Use sparingly

Prompt modals should be used sparingly, and only for important decisions or actions that cannot be undone. They should _not_ be used for trivial actions or actions that can be easily undone.

For most actions, a simple **Notification** message is sufficient to inform the user of the result of their action (or allow them to "undo" it).

## Destructive Usage

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need the user to confirm a destructive decision that will have a significant impact to their account or data." />

<CodePreview preview={<DestructivePreview />} />
