## Usage

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need display a list of navigation links that are not associated with the primary navigation." />

## Standard Nav Menu

<CodePreview preview={<BasicNavMenuPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need display a list of navigation links that show/hide when a button is clicked." />

## Positions

Navigation menus provide access to destinations and app functionality, such as switching accounts. They can either be permanently on-screen or opened and closed by a navigation menu icon. One navigation destination is always active.

<CodePreview preview={<PositionNavMenuPreview />} />

## Responsive Layout

A product's navigation component should change to suit the window size class and form factor of the screen.

Modal navigation drawers can be used at any window size but are most common in compact and medium window sizes.

Standard navigation drawers are best for expanded, large, and extra-large window sizes.
