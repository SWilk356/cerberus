## Non-destructive Usage

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need the user to confirm an important decision that needs to have attention drawn to it." />

<CodePreview preview={<NonDestructivePreview />} />

### Use sparingly

Confirm modals should be used sparingly, and only for important decisions or actions that cannot be undone. They should not be used for trivial actions or actions that can be easily undone.

For most actions, a simple **Notification** message is sufficient to inform the user of the result of their action (or allow them to "undo" it).

## Destructive Usage

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need the user to confirm a destructive decision that will have a significant impact to their account or data." />

<CodePreview preview={<DestructivePreview />} />
