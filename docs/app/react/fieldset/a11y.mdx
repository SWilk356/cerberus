} from '@/app/components/Admonition'
import OverviewList from '@/app/components/OverviewList'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Navigate to and activate a input field with assistive technology',
  'Receive and understand supporting text and error messages',
  'Navigate to and select interactive icons',
]} />

## Interaction &amp; Style

The containers for both filled and outlined text fields provide the same functionality. Changes to color and thickness of stroke help provide clear visual cues for interaction.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Keys     | Actions                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab      | Focus lands on (non-disabled) input       |

## Labeling Elements

If the UI text is correctly linked, assistive tech (such as a screenreader) will read the UI text followed by the component's role.

The accessibility label for a textfield is typically the same as the label for the textfield.
