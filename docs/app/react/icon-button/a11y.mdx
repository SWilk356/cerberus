} from '@/app/components/Admonition'
import OverviewList from '@/app/components/OverviewList'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Understand meaning of the icon',
  'Navigate to and activate an icon button with assistive technology',
  "When applicable, a tooltip is available to help describe the icon button's purpose"
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Similarly styled components shouldn't be used together if they don't each pass the 3:1 contrast ratio. Higher contrast helps differentiate between a group of similar components.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Keys     | Actions                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab      | Focus lands on (non-disabled) button       |
| Space / Enter      | Activates the (non-disabled) button                    |

## Labeling Buttons

The accessibility labels for icon buttons describe the action that the button is executing, such as Favorite, Bookmark, or Send message.
