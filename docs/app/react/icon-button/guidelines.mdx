## Usage

Use icon buttons to display actions in a compact layout. Icon buttons can represent opening actions such as opening an overflow menu or search, or represent binary actions that can be toggled on and off, such as favorite or bookmark.

Icon buttons can be grouped together or they can stand alone.

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to allow the user to trigger and action using an icon." />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="When you need to provide a way for the user to navigate somewhere - use a Link, TextLink, or NavMenu." />


## Standard Buttons

Standard icon buttons are used for primary actions on a page.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicIconButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need high priority actions or actions that are the only item on screen." />

## Outlined Buttons

Outlined icon buttons are used for secondary actions on a page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlinedIconButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a secondary action that is less important than the primary action." />

## Danger Buttons

Danger buttons are used for actions that are destructive, like deleting an item or canceling a process. They should be used sparingly, and only when the action is irreversible.

<CodePreview preview={<DangerIconButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a high impact destructive action such as deleting items or other places where a destructive action is the priority in the UI." />

## Ghost Buttons

Ghost buttons are used for tertiary actions on a page, like Help or Learn more. They should be used for actions that are less important than the secondary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<TextIconButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need lower priority actions such as that might be used for triggering more options." />

## Placement

Icon buttons are commonly used in other components, like top app bars and cards. These buttons should be used for common actions. Only display a few icon buttons at once.
