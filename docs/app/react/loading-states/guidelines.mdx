## Usage

<OverviewList intro="Execution depends on context:" rules={[
  'Skeletons show when a page is initially loading',
  'Spinners show when a request is being processed in result of a user action',
  'Try to use SSR for initial page loading and data-fetching on the client for user actions.',
]} />

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewPreview />} />


## Skeletons

Skeleton's are used when an application is not utilizing the benefits of initial server-side rendering to load a page.

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When a user navigates to a new page and app is still pending requests from client." />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="Do not use Skeletons as responses to actions. Instead use a Spinner." />

## Spinners

Spinners are used when a user action triggers a request to the server by using an action.

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When a user action triggers a request to the server." />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="Do not use Spinners as responses to page loads. Instead use a Skeleton." />
