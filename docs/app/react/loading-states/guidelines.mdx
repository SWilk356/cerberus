## Usage

<OverviewList intro="Execution depends on context:" rules={[
  'Skeletons show when a page is initially loading',
  'Spinners show when a request is being processed in result of a user action',
  'Try to use SSR for initial page loading and data-fetching on the client for user actions.',
  'Page content should not switch between Skeletons and Spinners.',
]} />

## Skeletons

Skeleton's are displayed when an application is taking longer than expected to load an initial page.

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewPreview />} />
This typically doesn't happen when utilizing server-side rendering (SSR) for page loads.

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When a user navigates to a new page and app is still pending requests from client after the browser has finished loading." />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="Do not use Skeletons as responses to actions. Instead use a Spinner." />

<SquigglyDivider />

## Spinners

Spinners are used when a user triggers a request to the server by using an action.

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewSpinnerPreview />} />
The page content should remain static until the new data has arrived.

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="Do not use Spinners as responses to page loads. Instead use a Skeleton." />
