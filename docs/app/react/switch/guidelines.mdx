## Alternate selection controls

Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles are the three main types of selection controls. They help people make choices, like selecting options or turning settings on and off.

Use checkboxes to select multiple related options in a list.

Use radio buttons to select a single option in a list.

Use switches to select standalone or more verbose options in a list, like settings.
