} from '@/app/components/Admonition'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Be alerted, but not disrupted, when a notification appears',
  'Move focus to an actionable notification',
  'Take action on a notification using assistive technology'
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Notification with actions shouldn't auto-dismiss. This way, users can read and interact with it at their own pace.

Notification without actions can auto-dismiss after a sufficient amount of time, however this can still be inaccessible on web without additional feedback.

Each platform has its own requirements for auto-dismiss durations, however common acceptable durations are 8 seconds.
