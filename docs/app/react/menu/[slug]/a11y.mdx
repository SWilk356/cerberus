## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Move between navigation destinations with assistive technology',
  'Select a particular navigation destination from a set',
  'Get appropriate feedback based on input type documented under Interaction & style'
]} />

## Visual Indicators

Icons are the primary focus of the navigation and such give the dominant cue of its state. Use a filled icon for the selected destination to differentiate from the outlined icons of non-selected destinations.
