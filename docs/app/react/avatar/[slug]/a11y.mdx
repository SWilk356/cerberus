import {
  WhenToUseAdmonition
} from '@/app/components/Admonition'
import OverviewList from '@/app/components/OverviewList'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Identify the user or entity',
  'Understand the context of the user or entity',
  'Interact with the user or entity',
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Similarly styled components shouldn't be used together if they don't each pass the 3:1 contrast ratio. Higher contrast helps differentiate between a group of similar components.
