## Common Usage

You can use Avatars in most places where you need to represent a user or entity. They can be used with images, names, or icons.

## Red Avatars

Red avatars are used to represent an invalid state. They are used to communicate that something is wrong or that an action is destructive.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicButtonPreview />} />
