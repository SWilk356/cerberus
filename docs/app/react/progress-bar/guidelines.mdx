## Usage

Progress indicators inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. They communicate an app's state and indicate available actions, such as whether users can navigate away from the current screen.

Display overall progress of a group rather than the progress of each item in the group.

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="To communicate overall progress of a group." />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="To communicate individual progress within a group." />
