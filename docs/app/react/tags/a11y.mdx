## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Use a tag to perform an action',
  'Navigate to a tag with keyboard or switch input',
  'Activate a tag with keyboard or switch input',
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Tags are often clustered components that need to pass the 3:1 contrast ratio. Higher contrast helps differentiate between a group of like components.

A tag that performs an action should present the same semantics as a button to a platform's accessibility API.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Keys     | Actions                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab      | Focus lands on (non-disabled) tag       |
| Space / Enter      | Activates the (non-disabled) tag                    |
