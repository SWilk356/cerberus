## Usage

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="When you need to provide a way for the user to navigate somewhere - use a Link, TextLink, or NavMenu." />

### Tags aren't buttons

Tags and buttons are similar; they both provide visual cues to prompt users to take actions and make selections.

However, while buttons are expected to appear consistently and with familiar calls to action, tags should be dynamic to the situation, and appear as a group of interactive or static elements.

Use tags to enhance the user's current journey and encourage action, and buttons to progress through the product and take significant actions.


## Filled Tags

Filled tags have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display content heavy sections within a single page." />

## Outline Tags

Outline tags are used for secondary actions on a page, like Cancel or Close. They should be used for actions that are less important than the primary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlineTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need medium priority actions or a secondary action to a primary button." />

## Rounded Tags

Rounded tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<RoundedTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need an alternative button shape (i.e. admin portal, etc.)." />

## Pill Tags

Pill tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<PillTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need an alternative button shape (i.e. admin portal, etc.)." />

## Closable Tags

Closable tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<ClosableTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need an alternative button shape (i.e. admin portal, etc.)." />

## Responsive Layouts

When scaling layouts for large screen devices, tags can adapt their visual presentation, alignment, and arrangement to fit different contexts and user needs.
