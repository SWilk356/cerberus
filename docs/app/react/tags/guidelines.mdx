## Usage

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="When you need to provide a way for the user to navigate somewhere - use a Link, TextLink, or NavMenu." />

### Tags aren't buttons

Tags and buttons are similar; they both provide visual cues to prompt users to take actions and make selections.

However, while buttons are expected to appear consistently and with familiar calls to action, tags should be dynamic to the situation, and appear as a group of interactive or static elements.

Use tags to enhance the user's current journey and encourage action, and buttons to progress through the product and take significant actions.


## Filled Buttons

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display content heavy sections within a single page." />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a high impact destructive action such as deleting items or other places where a destructive action is the priority in the UI." />

## Outline Buttons

Outline buttons are used for secondary actions on a page, like Cancel or Close. They should be used for actions that are less important than the primary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlineButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need medium priority actions or a secondary action to a primary button." />

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are used for tertiary actions on a page, like Help or Learn more. They should be used for actions that are less important than the secondary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<TextButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need lower priority actions such as that might be used for triggering more options." />

## Rounded Buttons

Rounded buttons are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<RoundedButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need an alternative button shape (i.e. admin portal, etc.)." />

## Responsive Layouts

When scaling layouts for large screen devices, buttons can adapt their visual presentation, alignment, and arrangement to fit different contexts and user needs.
