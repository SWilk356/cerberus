## Usage

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="When you need to provide a way for the user to perfom and action - use a Button or IconButton." />

### Tags aren't buttons

Tags and buttons are similar; they both provide visual cues to prompt users to take actions and make selections.

However, while buttons are expected to appear consistently and with familiar calls to action, tags should be dynamic to the situation, and appear as a group of interactive or static elements.

Use tags to enhance the user's current journey and encourage action, and buttons to progress through the product and take significant actions.


## Filled Tags

Filled tags have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a high priority meta-tag within a page section." />

## Outline Tags

Outline tags are used for secondary actions on a page, like Cancel or Close. They should be used for actions that are less important than the primary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlineTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need medium priority meta-tag to the primary one." />

## Square Tags

Sqaure tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<SquareTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a high priority meta-tag within a page section." />

## Pill Tags

Pill tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<PillTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need a meta tag for smaller spaces, like a Card." />

## Closable Tags

Closable tags are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<ClosableTagPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need a tag that controls filtering data being shown in the UI." />

## Responsive Layouts

When scaling layouts for large screen devices, tags can adapt their visual presentation, alignment, and arrangement to fit different contexts and user needs.
