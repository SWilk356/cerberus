<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Navigate to and activate a file uploader with assistive technology',
  'Select files to upload',
  'Receive feedback on the status of the upload',
]} />

## Interaction &amp; Style

Changes to color and thickness of stroke help provide clear visual cues for interaction.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Keys     | Actions                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab      | Focus lands on (non-disabled) input       |
| Enter    | Opens the file dialog to select a file to upload                |
| Space    | Opens the file dialog to select a file to upload                |

## Labeling Elements

If the UI text is correctly linked, assistive tech (such as a screenreader) will read the UI text followed by the component's role.

The accessibility label for a input is typically the same as the label for the input.
