## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Open and close a dialog',
  'Provide and submit other inputs if the dialog is interactive, such as a text field or selectable list',
  'Keep focus within the dialog until it is closed',
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive. This means they appear in front of app content and disrupt the flow of content for users who may, for example, be using a screen reader to navigate the page.

As such, dialogs should be used sparingly and only to provide critical information. Less critical information should be presented in a non-blocking way within the flow of app content.
