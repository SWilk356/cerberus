import OverviewList from '@/app/components/OverviewList'

## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Receive and understand supporting text and error messages',
]} />

## Labeling Elements

If the UI text is correctly linked, assistive tech (such as a screenreader) will read the UI text followed by the component's role.

It can be useful to provide a descriptive identifier for the field message - like `help:first_name` - to help users navigate to the field message with assistive technology.
