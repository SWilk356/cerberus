import { NoteAdmonition } from '@/app/components/Admonition'

## Installation

Install the Cerberus React library, with the package manager of your choice:

```bash
pnpm add @cerberus/react@npm:@cerberus-design/react
```

<NoteAdmonition
  description="The Cerberus React library requires the use of Panda-CSS and the Cerberus Core.
  Please be sure you have setup your project to use these libraries before using
  Cerberus React."
/>

## Typescript

The Cerberus React library is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions for all components.

## Customizing Icons

For the most part, the Cerberus React library is Icon agnostic. This means you can use any Icon library you prefer. However, there are times where a component needs a built-in icon. In these cases, the Cerberus React library provides a helper to make it easy to use any icon library you prefer.

### API & Usage

To use the `defineIcons` function, you must first import it from the Cerberus React library. Then, you can define the icons you want to use in your application. The `defineIcons` function will return an object with the same keys that are used within components, but with the values replaced with the new icon components.

This is purely for convenience and is not required to use the Cerberus React library.

```tsx title="API"
export interface DefinedIcons {
  invalid: CarbonIconType | ElementType
  toggleChecked: CarbonIconType | ElementType
}

define function defineIcons(icons: DefinedIcons): DefinedIcons
```

```tsx title="Example of using Lucide Icons"
import { defineIcons } from '@cerberus/react'
import { TriangleAlert } from 'lucide-react';

// You can also just call the function directly without assigning it to a variable
const icons = defineIcons({
  invalid: TriangleAlert,
})
```
