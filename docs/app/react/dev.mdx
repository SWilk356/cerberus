import { NoteAdmonition } from '@/app/components/Admonition'

## Installation

Install the Cerberus React library, with the package manager of your choice:

```bash
pnpm add @cerberus/react@npm:@cerberus-design/react
```

<NoteAdmonition
  description="The Cerberus React library requires the use of Panda-CSS and the Cerberus Core.
  Please be sure you have setup your project to use these libraries before using
  Cerberus React."
/>

## Typescript

The Cerberus React library is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions for all components.

## Customizing Icons

The Cerberus React library is Icon agnostic. This means you can use any Icon library you prefer. To customize the icons used in Cerberus React, you can use the `defineIcons` function to replace the default icons with your own.

See the [Customizing Icons](../preset/customizing#option-2-cerberus-configuration) guide for more information.
