## Usage

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

<OverviewList rules={[
  'Dialogs',
  'Modal Windows',
  'Forms',
  'Cards'
]} />


## Filled Buttons

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicButtonPreview />} />

## Danger Buttons

Danger buttons are used for actions that are destructive, like deleting an item or canceling a process. They should be used sparingly, and only when the action is irreversible.

<CodePreview preview={<DangerButtonPreview />} />

## Outline Buttons

Outline buttons are used for secondary actions on a page, like Cancel or Close. They should be used for actions that are less important than the primary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlineButtonPreview />} />

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are used for tertiary actions on a page, like Help or Learn more. They should be used for actions that are less important than the secondary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<TextButtonPreview />} />

## Responsive Layouts

When scaling layouts for large screen devices, buttons can adapt their visual presentation, alignment, and arrangement to fit different contexts and user needs.
