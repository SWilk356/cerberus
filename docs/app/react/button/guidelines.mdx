## Usage

<OverviewList intro="Used in places like:" rules={[
  'Dialogs',
  'Modal Windows',
  'Forms',
  'Cards'
]} />

<WhenNotToUseAdmonition description="When you need to provide a way for the user to navigate somewhere - use a Link, TextLink, or NavMenu." />


## Filled Buttons

Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the FAB, and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow, like Save, Join now, or Confirm.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display content heavy sections within a single page." />

## Danger Buttons

Danger buttons are used for actions that are destructive, like deleting an item or canceling a process. They should be used sparingly, and only when the action is irreversible.

<CodePreview preview={<DangerButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display a high impact destructive action such as deleting items or other places where a destructive action is the priority in the UI." />

## Outline Buttons

Outline buttons are used for secondary actions on a page, like Cancel or Close. They should be used for actions that are less important than the primary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<OutlineButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need medium priority actions or a secondary action to a primary button." />

## Text Buttons

Text buttons are used for tertiary actions on a page, like Help or Learn more. They should be used for actions that are less important than the secondary action on the page.

<CodePreview preview={<TextButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need lower priority actions such as that might be used for triggering more options." />

## Rounded Buttons

Rounded buttons are used for actions that are used as an alternate themed Default.

<CodePreview preview={<RoundedButtonPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need an alternative button shape (i.e. admin portal, etc.)." />

## Responsive Layouts

When scaling layouts for large screen devices, buttons can adapt their visual presentation, alignment, and arrangement to fit different contexts and user needs.
