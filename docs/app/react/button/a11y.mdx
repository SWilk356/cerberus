## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Use a button to perform an action',
  'Navigate to and activate a button with assistive tech (i.e., focus)'
]} />

### Interaction &amp; Style

Similarly styled components shouldn't be used together if they don't each pass the 3:1 contrast ratio. Higher contrast helps differentiate between a group of similar components.
