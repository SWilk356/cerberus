## Usage

Tabs organize groups of related content that are at the same level of hierarchy.

<CodePreview preview={<BasicTabsPreview />} />

<WhenToUseAdmonition description="When you need to display content heavy sections within a single page." />

## Placement

Tabs are displayed in a single row, with each tab connected to the content it represents. As a set, all tabs are unified by a shared topic.
