## Use Cases

<OverviewList intro="Users should be able to:" rules={[
  'Navigate to a checkbox with assistive technology',
  'Toggle the checkbox on and off',
  'Get appropriate feedback based on input type documented under Interaction & style',
]} />

## Interaction & Style

The parent checkbox has three states: selected, unselected, and mixed.

Checkboxes can be selected or unselected regardless of the state of the other checkboxes in a group.

If some, but not all, child checkboxes are checked, the parent checkbox becomes mixed. Selecting an mixed parent checkbox will check all of its child checkboxes.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Keys     | Actions                                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab      | To move to the next element in a group       |
| Space    | Toggles a focused checkbox between selected and unselected    |

## Labeling Elements

If the UI text is correctly linked to the checkbox, assistive tech (such as a screen reader) will read the UI text followed by the component's role.

The accessibility label for an individual checkbox is typically the same as its adjacent text label.
