# Theme

**The color palette is a key element in the design system. It is used to create a visual hierarchy, guide the user's attention, and reinforce the brand identity.**

## Theme vs. Mode

It is important to understand the difference between the theme and mode.

### Theme

The theme is the color palette that is used to style the design system. It is divided into six categories: neutral, action, info, success, warning, and danger. Each category has a set of tokens that define the color palette.

### Mode

The mode is the color scheme that is used to style the design system. It is divided into two categories: light and dark.

<NoteAdmonition description="Cerberus comes built in with one theme (cerberus) that includes a light and dark mode." />

## Understanding the Color Palette

Cerberus uses a semantic token design to define a theme divided into six palette categories:

| Palette     | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Neutral     | Used for anything on a page that is not an action.             |
| Action      | Used for primary actions on a page.                            |
| Info        | Used for informative elements on a page.                       |
| Success     | Used for success messages and positive feedback.               |
| Warning     | Used for warning messages and alerts.                          |
| Danger      | Used for error messages and negative feedback.                 |


## Understanding the Tokens

Each category has a set of tokens that define the color palette. The tokens create a scalable syntax that scales across the design system.

The tokens use the following naming convention:
**[palette?]-[usage]-[prominence?]-[interaction?]**

| Name        | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Palette     | The category/context of where the color is used.               |
| Usage       | How the color is used within the context.                      |
| Prominence  | The hierarchy of the color used within the page context.       |
| Interaction | The element interaction type the color should be applied to.   |

## Using the Tokens

With the design mentioned above, we can put this into practice by using the tokens to style the components. Let's take a button as an example.

<CodePreview preview={<OverviewButtonPreview />} />

Because a button is an action (an element a user triggers an action with), we would use the **Action** palette.

| Purpose     | Token                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Background  | `action.bg.initial`                                            |
| Text        | `action.text.initial`                                          |
| Hover BG    | `action.bg.hover`                                              |
| Border      | `action.border.initial`                                        |
