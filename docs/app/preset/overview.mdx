# Overview

The Cerberus Panda CSS Preset adds a set of core features to the Cerberus Design System.

## Installation

Install the Cerberus Panda Preset library, with the package manager of your choice:

```bash
pnpm install @cerberus-design/panda-preset
```

## Setup

<NoteAdmonition description="This guide assumes you are familiar with Panda CSS. If you are not, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the framework." />

### Update the Panda Configuration

Once you have installed and setup Panda CSS and added the Cerberus Panda Preset, you need to update your Panda configuration to include the Cerberus Panda Preset.

```ts title="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'
import pandaPreset from '@pandacss/preset-panda'
import { cerberusPreset, cerberusConfig } from '@cerberus-design/panda-preset'

export default defineConfig({
  ...cerberusConfig,

  include: ['./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  exclude: [],

  presets: [pandaPreset, cerberusPreset],
})
```

#### Update your local styles

Now that you have extended Panda, you need to update your local styles by running the `prepare` script.

```bash
pnpm run prepare
```

### Step 4 - Setup Cerberus Fonts (optional)

If you would like to use the Brand font associated with Cerberus, we recommend Poppins. Unfortunately, it is not a variable font, so another great solution which is, is the Inter font (comes pre-configured in NextJS apps).

NextJS usage:

```ts title="app/layout.tsx"
import { Poppins } from 'next/font/google'

const poppins = Poppins({
  display: 'swap',
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['400', '600', '700', '800'],
})
```

### Using the Cerberus React & Icons packages

If you are interested in using the Cerberus React and Icons packages, install those now:

```bash
pnpm add @cerberus-design/{react,icons}
```

### Add a Cerberus script

To help make maintaining a breeze, add this new script to your `package.json` to use when you are ready to upgrade Cerberus:

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "up:cerberus": "pnpm up @cerberus-design/{panda-preset,react,icons}"
}
```
