# Contributing to Cerberus Design System

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! âœ¨.

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/omnifed/cerberus/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable. Solid accepts a number of contributions from the broader community. More hands indeed make lighter work. We're however selective of the types of contributions we receive.

This usually involves vetting code quality, current focus, alignment with team philosophies etc. It's typically a good idea to submit a proposal for a change before spending time implementing it. This is to ensure that your efforts align with the current needs or more practically that work isn't completed by multiple contributors.

Note: If you would like your project listed here please submit a PR or contact a core/ecosystem member on Discord.

## Team Structure & Organization

There are a lot of opportunities to get involved. We organize Solid community efforts via Discord and typically onboard dedicated contributors into focused teams:

- Core Docs & Admin (headed by [@caseybaggz](https://github.com/caseybaggz))

Most team members are part of the Ecosystem Team or Core Team. Entry into these groups is selected by Core Members only. We do not accept applications or requests for entry. Selections are made ad-hoc according to internal needs. Selections are typically announced at Community Meetings which occur quarterly.

## Where do I start?

If you haven't found any interesting information on this page then we encourage you to start hacking at a Cerberus related utility or package that does. Building useful tools for fellow OSS ecosystem and Cerberus users enhances the whole platform.

We can't wait to see what you build!
