# TBD

TBD is the official design system for the Digital University product. It is a collection of tools and reusable components for React that can be used to build a consistent and accessible user interface with maximum flexibility.

## Repository structure

This is a monorepo that uses [pnPm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the runtime language. You will need to install these tools to work on this project.

## Getting started

### Install Required Tools

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
2. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Setup the project

After you fork and clone the repository, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all the dependencies for the project including the workspaces.
